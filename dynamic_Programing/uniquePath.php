        $matrix[0][$col] = 1;

    // Fill in the rest of the matrix by summing the values above and to the left of each cell
    for($row = 1 ; $row < $n; $row++){
        for($col = 1 ; $col < $m; $col++){
            $matrix[$row][$col] = $matrix[$row-1][$col] + $matrix[$row][$col-1];
        }

    // Return the bottom-right cell of the matrix, which contains the number of unique paths
    return $matrix[$n-1][$m-1];
}
?>

Here's a summary of the changes made to the code:

The array_push() function was replaced with array_fill() to create a 2D array with all values initialized to 0.
The loop that initializes the first column of the matrix was corrected to set the correct value for each cell.
A new loop was added to initialize the first row of the matrix.
A new loop was added to fill in the rest of the matrix by summing the values above and to the left of each cell.
The function now returns the bottom-right cell of the matrix, which contains the number of unique paths.
